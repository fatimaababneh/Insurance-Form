ðŸ“„ Insurance Dynamic Form Engine
This application is designed as a dynamic and reusable form engine driven entirely by JSON schemas. It allows the creation of highly customizable multi-step forms that can adapt to any companyâ€™s requirementsâ€”without the need to modify any core logic or UI components.

Built with Next.js (App Router) and styled using Tailwind CSS, the solution ensures scalability, maintainability, and easy customization. All form configurationsâ€”fields, step structure, styling, and brandingâ€”are defined in a single JSON file, enabling fast integration and seamless updates.

ðŸ’¡ The Challenge
Insurance companies often need tailored, multi-step forms to collect complex information from users. These requirements can vary significantly between companies, and over time, forms need to evolveâ€”often with A/B testing to measure performance.

âœ… My Solution
I developed a flexible form generation engine that can:

Dynamically render form steps and fields based on a JSON schema.

Apply unique branding and styling per company from the same schema.

Support A/B testing by allowing multiple schema variants.

Scale effortlesslyâ€”new forms can be added by simply creating a new JSON configuration file.

No changes are required in the form logic or components. Just plug in the JSON and the system takes care of rendering and behavior.

ðŸ”¥ Key Advantages
Full Branding Customization
Apply colors, fonts, logos, and layout styles through the JSON configuration.

Flexible Step and Field Control
Define unlimited steps and fields, with support for conditional visibility, validation, and field types.

A/B Testing Support
Test different versions of a form with variant schemas to optimize conversions and user experience.

Rapid Deployment for New Clients
Generate complete, multi-step forms in minutes by providing one JSON file per companyâ€”no development time required.

ðŸš€ Why This Matters
This architecture enables product and development teams to move faster and collaborate better. Marketers, designers, and product owners can shape new form experiences by updating JSON definitionsâ€”freeing developers to focus on higher-level logic and platform improvements.

Itâ€™s a robust foundation for building a white-label, multi-tenant dynamic form system suited for any company in the insurance spaceâ€”and beyond.
