# Insurance-Dynamic-Form

In this application I have focused on create a dynamic reusable form engine drevin by JSON Schemas that can handle any type of forms structure with any number of steps in each form. I have built this app using next js with app routing and tailwind styling library, mainly I am using JSON files that contain the whole content for any form such as : fields, brand styling, steps order. I am thinking about making dynamic form for any company with A/B testing strategy and to be my code scalable readable simple as possible so any one can read and understand and update anything in the code easily. 

My Solution 

my solution is produce a dynamic form that can handle any company requists without the need to edit any thing in the main components.
just adding json for the new company with required fields with all thier attriputes and styling enough to generate a ready form with full functionality and customization branding for each
any number of steps for the form can be handeled 


Advantages in this solution

1- fully customization styling and branding 
2- fully customization for steps and fields 
3- upport A/B testing
4- one json that takes few minutes will create a completely new form with multible steps and samples for testing
